### Solution
```
class Solution {
    public int shipWithinDays(int[] weights, int days) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = 500 * 50000;
        while(start < end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if(enough(weights, mid, days)) {
                end = mid;
            } else {
                start = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return start;
    }

    private boolean enough(int [] weights, int num, int days) {
        int sum = 0;
        int count = 1;
        for(int weight: weights) {
            if(weight > num) {
                return false;
            }
            if(sum + weight > num) {
                count++;
                sum = weight;
            } else {
                sum += weight;
            }
            if(count > days) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
### Conclusion
- Runtime beat 36%
- Memory beat 5%

#### the end could be the sum of array
